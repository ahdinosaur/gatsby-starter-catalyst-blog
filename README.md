# \[WIP\] Gatsby Starter Catalyst Basic

**Currently a work in progress - please be aware that there are rapid breaking changes at this point in the development. Not currerntly recommended for use.**

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) were designed to provide an opinoinated set of progressive themes and starters that can be used to accelerate web development. I built this to meet my own needs and imagine that others would also have similar needs.
