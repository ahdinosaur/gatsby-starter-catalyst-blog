## Overview

This is a starter site implementing `gatsby-theme-catalyst-blog`. Please see [Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Core](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core) for relevant documentation. Please submit and track all issues in the main theme repo as this is where most code changes would be located.

## Catalyst Themes and Starters

- [Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Core](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core): _This acts as the core theme on which all other themes are based. It houses a basic, unstyled, site architecture along with most commonly needed dependencies. Uses theme-ui under the hood for styling changes and MDX for pages._
  - [Gatsby-Starter-Catalyst-Core](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-core): _Starter for the core theme to make installation and customization easier_
- [Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Blog](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-blog): _This acts as an extension of the core theme adding basic blog functionality. Based heavily on the core blog theme from GatbsyJS._
  - [Gatsby-Starter-Catalyst-Blog](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-blog): _Starter for the blog theme to make installation and customization easier_
