# Gatsby Catalyst Design System

The following are components that I built to suit my own development needs. You may find them useful in your projects as well.

## Button Internal

Simple series of buttons for internal navigation, uses Gatsby `<Link>` element internally. Uses [variants](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants) from theme-ui to control appearance and styles.

```
import { ButtonInternal } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"
<ButtonInternal to="/page-2" text="Button Internal" variant="primary" />
```

<p><ButtonInternal to="/page-2" text="Primary" variant="primary" /></p>

<p><ButtonInternal to="/page-2" text="Secondary" variant="secondary" /></p>

<p><ButtonInternal to="/page-2" text="Large" variant="large" /></p>
