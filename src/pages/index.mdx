# Gatsby Starter Catalyst Core

[Documentation](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core) about the Catalyst themes and starters is available on Github.

This is the "core" theme that acts as a base for all other Catalyst themes and starters. It is intended to be barebones and serve as a blank canvas on top of which child themes and starters can be easily scaffolded.

I built this because it was something I needed to accelerate my workflow for freelance projects and assume others would also find it useful.
